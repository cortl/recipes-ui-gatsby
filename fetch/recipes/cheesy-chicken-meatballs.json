    "instructions": [
        "Set oven to 420F/216C.",
        "Add all the ingredients for the chicken meatballs to a large bowl. Thoroughly mix together, then form meatballs.  Note: lean ground meat tends to be very sticky so I like to spray my hands with a little olive oil while rolling the meatballs  so they are easier to make.",
        "Place the meatballs on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and make sure they have space.",
        "Bake in the oven for NO MORE than 12 minutes.  I bake mine for 8 â€“ 10 minutes at 420F.  Set aside once finished."
