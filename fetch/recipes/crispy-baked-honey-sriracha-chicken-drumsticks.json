  "ingredients": [
    "6 chicken drumsticks (about 1.75 lbs.)",
    " Pinch of salt and pepper",
    "2 Tbsp cornstarch",
    "1/4 cup sriracha",
    "2 Tbsp butter",
    "2 Tbsp honey"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Line a baking sheet with foil, then top it with wire cooling racks to hold the chicken up off the baking sheet. For easy cleaning, spritz the wire racks with non-stick spray.",
    "Place the chicken drumsticks in a large bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch over top, then stir until the drumsticks are evenly coated in cornstarch.",
    "Place the coated chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the drumsticks for about 50 minutes, or until the surface is golden brown and crispy.",
    "While the chicken is in the oven, combine the sriracha, butter, and honey in a small sauce pot. Heat over a low flame until the butter is melted and the sauce is smooth. Set the sauce aside.",
    "When the chicken comes out of the oven, brush the sauce liberally over the surface of the chicken, then serve."
