    "Kitchen was probably too warm, should leave in the fridge to chill out a bit more, also be REALLY generous with the sugar on top, also use the amount of blueberries - probably added too much"

    "For the Dough: Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and coconut oil in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until oil disappears into a powdery meal. Transfer to a medium bowl, then toss with blueberries and lemon zest. Stir in coconut milk with a flexible spatula to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, pat into a 7-inch round, and refrigerate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).",
    "To Bake:Using a chef’s knife, cut chilled wheel of dough into 6 wedges. Sprinkle generously with toasted or turbinado sugar, if using, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes, and serve warm."
