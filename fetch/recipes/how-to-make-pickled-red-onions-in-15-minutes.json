    "3 Tbsp white sugar",
    "1.5 Tbsp salt",
    "1/2 tsp peppercorns",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Thinly slice the red onion and peel the garlic. Place the onion and garlic in a large glass or ceramic bowl.",

    "Once boiling, pour the vinegar over the sliced onion and garlic*. Press the onion down so all the pieces are submerged, then let the mixture cool to room temperature.",
