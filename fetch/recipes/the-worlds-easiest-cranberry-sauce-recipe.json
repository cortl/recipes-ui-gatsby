  "ingredients": [
    "1 (12-ounce; 340g) bag fresh or frozen cranberries",
    "1 cup sugar (5 ounces; 140g)",
    "1/2 cup water (4 ounces; 115g)",
    "2 strips zest and 2 tablespoons (30ml) juice from 1 orange (optional)",
    "1 cinnamon stick (optional)",
    "Pinch kosher salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until berries start to pop. Press berries against side of pan with a wooden spoon and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until berries are completely broken down and achieve a jam-like consistency, about 10 minutes total. Remove from heat and allow to cool about 30 minutes. Stir in water in 1-tablespoon increments to adjust to desired consistency. Cranberry sauce can be served immediately or stored in the refrigerator for several months."
